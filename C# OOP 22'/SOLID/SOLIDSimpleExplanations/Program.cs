            //1.1 Every class should be responsible for only a single part of the functionality and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

            //2.1. Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension BUT closed for modification.

            //3.1. Derived types must be completely subtituable for their base type ->The Child class must subtitute the Parent class

            //4.1. The clients should NOT be forced to depend on methods it does NOT use. Segregate to smaller and more specific ones.
